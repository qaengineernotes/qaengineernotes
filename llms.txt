# QA Engineer Notes: LLMs Knowledge Index

## 1. Core Concepts & Definitions

- **Quality Assurance (QA):** Systematic process to ensure a product meets requirements and standards, focusing on prevention of defects ([Glossary](https://qablogs.com/blogs/qa-testing-glossary.html)).
- **Software Testing:** Evaluation of software to ensure it behaves as expected and is free of defects. Includes manual, automated, functional, non-functional, and regression testing.
- **Shift-Left Testing:** Testing as early as possible in the development lifecycle to catch defects early ([Shift-Left Guide](https://qablogs.com/blogs/shift-left-testing-early-sdlc-qa.html)).
- **Test Case:** A set of conditions to determine if a system meets requirements ([How to Write a Great Test Case](https://qablogs.com/blogs/how-to-write-great-test-case.html)).
- **Defect/Bug:** A flaw causing unexpected behavior or deviation from requirements.
- **Regression Testing:** Re-testing after changes to ensure existing functionality is not broken.
- **Exploratory Testing:** Unscripted, dynamic testing to uncover unexpected issues.

## 3. Best Practices

- **Risk-Based Testing:** Focus on high-risk areas that impact user experience or business operations.
- **Test Pyramid:** Emphasize unit tests, fewer integration tests, and minimal but comprehensive end-to-end tests.
- **Continuous Optimization:** Regularly review and improve QA processes.
- **Cross-Browser & Device Testing:** Ensure compatibility across browsers and devices.
- **Automation:** Start with unit tests, expand to integration and E2E tests. Use automation frameworks suitable for your stack.
- **Documentation:** Maintain clear, concise documentation for test cases, processes, and standards.
- **Metrics:** Track defect detection rate, test coverage, MTTR, and customer-reported issues.
- **Collaboration:** Foster shared responsibility for quality across teams.
